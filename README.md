Letters of Recommendation is an online UMBC application that manages a letter of recommendation request process. Letter requesters must specify a letter writer and potential job information, as well as upload a cover letter, resume, and unofficial transcript for consideration. There is no limit to the number of letters a person may request. Letter writers may register their interest in fulfilling requests directed to them by accepting or declining requests. Each person requesting a letter of recommendation may only view their own requests. Likewise, letter writers may only view and manage their designated requests.
